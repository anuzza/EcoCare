            <strong>Our Story</strong>
            
            <p>
              This is the Eco Options story. <br />
              It begins with Jemimah, our Founder. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Eco Options began with a conversation Jemimah had with a friend about the discomfort of pads and how her monthly expenditure on periods was taking a toll on her finances during the covid lockdown. The friend introduced her to menstrual cups and 3 months after using one, she was mind-blown! Why wasn't every menstruator in Uganda using this?!
            </p>

            <p>
            After doing extensive research about it, Jemimah and Olivia co-founded Eco Options to ease the financial burden of menstruating for fellow women especially those in Uganda. With our sustainable options, the average Ugandan woman is able to save up to 95% of the total amount she spends on disposable pads in a year! Notwithstanding the comfort,  time saved, and positive impact of our products on the environment. With our work, we hope to interest more menstruators in our Eco Options.
