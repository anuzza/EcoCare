              Eco Options is a social enterprise birthed from the need to revolutionize menstrual care in Uganda. We aim to change attitudes and improve lives by providing innovative sustainable period options for everyone regardless of income. We use the power of business to tackle social and environmental challenges resulting from period poverty in Uganda.
